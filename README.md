# network-auto-lab
## Assignment 2

This repository acts as our network automation environment. We will be able to use GitHub actions and code up some network configuration playbooks that we can pipe to GNS3.

My environment involves running a WSL Ubuntu environment with Ansible installed. This will be the control node. WSL will interact with GNS3 devices to allow configuration via SSH.
